It looks at each opened file and sets file specific tab settings (hard/soft tabs, tab length) based on the content of the file instead of always using the editor defaults.\n\nYou might have atom configured to use 4 spaces for tabs but open a rails project which defaults to 2 spaces. Without this package, you would have to change your tabstop settings globally or risk having inconsistent lead spacing in your files.\n\n\n## TODO\n\n* Use some sort of calculation (frequency, average, gcd) to figure out the most frequent tab setting in a file (currently gets smallest tab in first 100 lines)\n* Waiting on event to listen for when a newly opened file has been parsed so we can depend on `editor.isBufferRowCommented`\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jtokoph/auto-detect-indentation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jtokoph/auto-detect-indentation)\n\n# Special Thanks To Contributors\n\n[Fran√ßois Galea](https://github.com/fgalea)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jtokoph/auto-detect-indentation/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jtokoph/auto-detect-indentation","_id":"auto-detect-indentation@0.4.2","_shasum":"d3275dd5f49eacc8741d26e20c8a689525abb2a3","_resolved":"file:../d-11561-29423-7r6j1k/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11561-29423-7r6j1k/package.tgz"}
