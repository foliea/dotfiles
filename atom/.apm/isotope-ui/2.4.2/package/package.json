It provides an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast.\n\n![flat background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/flat.png)\n\n![gradient background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/gradient.png)\n\n![image background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/image.png)\n\n## Features\n\n**New feature** - a truly minimal mode!  \n![flat background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/minimal.png)\n\n- Automatically adapts to your favourite syntax theme\n- Configurable!\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Choose from a number of fonts included in this theme, or match the editor's font.
